Add all of these functions below okay without creating a single syntax error in the process.

main.conf

concurrency=1
capsolvertoken=
resend_attempts=3
resend_delay=15

input the capsolver token from the index.js into the main.conf file inside of the configs folder
the resend attempts is the amount of times to press resend the prompt if no press is detected.
the resend delay is how how many seconds per resend prompt attempt
concurrency is just the concurrency

emails are from input.txt inside mails/input/

concurrency works like this.

if there are 4 emails and the concurrency is 2 it does this

it will split the email list so 2 emails per concurrent run
and each concurrent instance will run 1 email get the result then run the second straight away

they will be in true parralel and each concurrent instance will have its own terminal
the console logs will be saved per email in its dedicated folder inside of debug-logs/email/console
they console logs at the top will also include the average ram usage

console updates
------------------
make the console less bloated so no link spam it just gives basic sentences for each run
so it says basic shit like for example
email@gmail.com -- start run
email@gmail.com -- entering email
email@gmail.com -- captcha detected
email@gmail.com -- browser unsafe / switching useragent and restarting
email@gmail.com -- RAM USAGE AVERAGE xxmb/s

you understand basic shit

then screenshots for the run are also saved in their dedicated folder inside of debug-logs/email/screenshots  and so are html in debug-logs/email/html-pages

then for the saves. there are 3 folders inside of mails/output being pressed unpressed and unpromtable with each having an output.txt inside of it.
if a mail that was run through the tool gets a result of a press wether yes or no it is saved inside of pressed
if a mail that was run and the phone prompt page isnt detected it goes into unpromtable
if a mail that was run and has the phone prompt sent and resent but gets no result it goes into promtable-nopress

each the folders have a output.txt

mails\output\promptable-nopress\output.txt
mails\output\pressed\output.txt
mails\output\unpromtable\output.txt

next

if the email is input and then next is pressed and the page says this on it 

"Couldn't sign you in"
"This browser or app may not be secure."

it will say in console
email@gmail.com -- browser unsafe / switching useragent and restarting
and switch useragent and restart with the same mail
